    <h2 class="section-header">About</h2>
    <p class="story">
      My story began long ago inside of a small room of a house in Louisiana&hellip;
    </p>
    <p class="story">
      The tap-tap-tap of the clicky Commodore 64 keys beneath my fingertips quietly echoing through the night as I work through writing program after program. I owe my love of programming to my father who started me off on a path that would carry me through my childhood as a hobby, into what is now a full professional career.
    </p>

    <p class="story">
      Since 1988 I have developed software and games for a variety of platforms using a plethora of programming languages including C++, C#, ActionScript 3.0, Python, Lua, Java Ruby, and JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p class="story">
      I have written literally millions of lines of code in total for the Commodore 64, DOS, Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, NES, SNES, TurboGrafx16, Sega Genesis, Gameboy Advance, Nintendo DS, and of course, the Web.
    </p>

    <p class="story">
      I am a happily&ndash;married father of three absolutely wonderful children. Life is short and balancing work and family is of the utmost importance to me. I am not afraid of hard work, and have a proven track record of being reliable and trustworthy.
    </p>

    <p class="story">
      I am a US-based software developer who is open and honest (<em>sometimes too open and honest</em>) about everything I do. I get things done and get them done right.
    </p>

    <p class="story">
      I am self&mdash;taught, and driven by my love for programming, I have been on an endless quest for knowledge and mastership of everything about computer science. I love to write code for the sake of writing it.
    </p>

    <p class="story">
      I have probably written a hundred thousand lines that never were saved. (<em>In hindsight, I wish that I had saved them for posterity and to share them with my kids.</em>)
    </p>

    <p class="story">
      Computers have been my focus in life for the last 30 years and I now have many completed (<em>and naturally, a relative number of incomplete</em>) projects under my belt, and have worked very hard to obtain a vast in-depth knowledge of computers and software.
    </p>

    <p class="story">
      I have worked in an agile development environment, a fully-remote (<em>before it became necessity thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020</em>) software engineer, for several years, and I have experience with engineering code using design patterns and using UML to communicate such constructions.
    </p>

    <p class="story">
      I married an amazing artist who inspired me to expand my skills in all directions. In addition to being a solid programmer, I am also a professional graphics artist.
    </p>

    <p class="story">
      I possess considerable skill with both 2D and 3D applications including Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Affinity Designer, Blender, 3ds max, Maya, Cinema4D, Wings3D, GIMP and Inkscape to name just a few applications I have used in my craft over the years.
    </p>

    <p class="story">
      I have created dozens of 2D tilesets and texture packs, game UI, icons, and 3D models and scenes. I have done lettering and typography for comics, books, flyers, brochures, etc...
    </p>

    <p class="story">
      My father has taught me many things including being a musician. I play guitar, digital piano, and enjoy using sample-based tracking software for creating rich aural experiences.
    </p>

    <p class="story">
      I'm the guy who everyone comes to for help. As a technology educator, I have paved the way for hundreds of new software developers.
    </p>

    <p class="story">
      I look forward to the future.
    </p>

    <p class="story">
      Thanks for reading.
